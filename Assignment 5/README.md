Continue building on what you have made in Assignment 4

## Reading materials
- Sensors
  - Sensors overview
  - Motion sensor
- Background tasks
  - Services (all subtopics)

## New app components
- New tab 'Wiggle Wiggle' with new fragment
- App should be able to set a service that in the background monitors when you wiggle your phone, then shows notification.

## New app requirements
- The wiggle tab shows **Appbar** action 'set wiggle'. Furthermore the tab shows if the service is set and running or not. (choose your own GUI elements) [look & feel] [app bar] [services]
- Use a service that runs in the background an monitors the motion sensors of the device. If you wiggle the phone, a notifications should be send to the notification centre. [sensors]
- Define your own 'algorithm' to detect wiggling. make your own thresholds.
- The app AUTOMATICALLY shows a notification 'Everything ok? ' every time you wiggle the phone,
- Bonus: make GUI elements to make the wiggle algorithm as customization as possible .
- Use the debugger to place breakpoints when testing the app. play around with it!
- Don't forget to use themes and styles correctly!

**Done when you show René the function**
